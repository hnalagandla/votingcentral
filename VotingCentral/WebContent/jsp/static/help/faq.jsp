					Voting is a very powerful concept. When everyone comes together to discuss and vote on various current issues 
					it is not only educational but has a potential to bring about a sea of change. The idea here is to create an extremely transparent polling 
					and discussion platform which can facilitate democratic thinking. 
					Here are some cool features we offer.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Community Building. Everyone can create Polls and anyone can vote in those polls. 
							This is an extremely powerful community 
							building platform and thought provoking for individuals. 
							Each poll also contains a comments board where the users 
							get to voice their thoughts about the issue at hand, before
							 and after voting. The comments board also helps in 
							 conveying the sentiments of the community in a very 
							 organized fashion and encourages mutual dialogue.							
						</li><br>
						<li>Multiple Perspectives of the results. Once a user has a participated in a poll the user gets to see the results of the polls from various perspectives. The user can dissect the poll results based on various parameters like.
							a.	Location. (Zip code, State, Country)
							b.	Gender
							c.	Age groups etc.
						</li><br>
						<li>
							Time Based Trended Results.
							One other key component of this website is the ability to 
							show poll results over a period of time. This is what we call 
							as a Trended Poll. For example, a question “How would you rate George W. 
							Bush's Presidency?” is 
							valid over a period of 8 years. The Trended Poll shows how the question was answered during the 8 year period. 							The results generated for this 
							kind of Poll are unique in that we can show trends over a 
							period of time. 
						</li><br>
						<li>
							Make it Universally Available. This trended information and the ability to dissect the poll results is 
							valuable and useful information but currently available 
							only to large organizations that organize the polls and 
							sell the results to people who can afford to buy it. 
							The regular consumer or participant in the poll doesn't get 
							to see the full picture of actual results of the Poll. Our 
							effort is try to make everything transparent and free. If a user has participated in the 
							poll they will get a chance to look at the results in the 
							same way as the poll creator.							
						</li><br>
						<li>
							Social Networking with a purpose. One of the main goals of VotingCentral is to allow everyone to 
							connect, participate and motivate. The site provides functionality to do exactly the same. 							
						</li><br>

				<td bgcolor="#F2F2F2" style="padding:5px;">	
					There are multiple reasons
					<ul>
						<li>We want to make sure that the process of voting is fair and least error prone. Hence it is important to make
						 sure that we prevent duplicate voting among other things. Ensuring that each user creates
						 a unique account is one effective way of acheving this.</li>
						<li>Upon creating an account you will get the added capability of 
						tracking your various polls. For eg. Polls you created, polls you voted in, polls you commented in, 
						pictures you uploaded into various contests .etc.</li>
